# Security

## Unlocking Settings

When you press the "Unlock Settings" button, you will be taken to the passcode page. If your device does not have an admin passcode set, pressing this button will automatically unlock all settings. When the settings are unlocked, you will see a white lock icon in the bottom right corner of the screen.

## Locking Settings

To lock all the settings on your device, press the "Lock Settings" button. If a passcode is set, you will need to enter it again to access the settings. Additionally, the settings will be automatically locked when you leave the settings pages.
