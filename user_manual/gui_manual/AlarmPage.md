# Alarm

The Alarm page allows you to set the settings for the alarm that will be used when it is impossible to make emergency phone calls.

## Alarm Message

This message will be spoken loudly by the system in case of emergency. The message will be passed to the Google text-to-speech engine, which will generate a mp3 file. This file will be played, so it is recommended to include meaningful words such as "someone has overdosed" in the message so that people have a better understanding of the incident.

## Voice Volume

You can adjust the volume of the alarm using the slider. The best volume setting should make the alarm message clear.

## Generating File

You need to first generate the mp3 file using the Generate button. This function needs Internet connection.

## Testing

You can test the current settings using the test button. It is recommended to start with a lower volume setting before increasing the volume. Remember to save the settings after testing, as changes will not be automatically saved.
