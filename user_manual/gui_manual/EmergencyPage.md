# Emergency Call

The Emergency Call page allows you to set the emergency call destination, address, and message that will be used when making an emergency call.

## Important!

After entering the emergency address, you must also update the emergency address in your Twilio account. Failure to do so will result in high costs on your bill and may delay the response time of the emergency service.

## Emergency Phone Number

This is the destination for the emergency call. In most cases, it should be set to 911 to call emergency medical services in the event of an overdose incident. You can also set it to another phone number, such as the phone number of a local hospital or public safety department. Please make sure to include the area code when entering the phone number if you are not using 911 as the destination. The system will automatically check the validity of the phone number. If the entered phone number is valid, a green border will be shown around the text box. If it is invalid, the border will be red. Please note that the system does not prevent invalid phone numbers from being saved, but this will cause phone call requests to fail.

## Emergency Address

This is the installation address of the Naloxone safety kit. Make sure to be specific about the address, including the room and floor number, as well as the street name.

## Emergency Message

This is a specific message that you may want paramedics to be aware of immediately, such as the route to the address. This information will be sent to the emergency service when making phone calls.
