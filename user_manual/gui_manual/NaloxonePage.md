# Naloxone

The Naloxone page allows you to update the information for the Naloxone nasal spray stored in the safety kit. You can use the slider to set a new maximum temperature for storing the Naloxone and a new expiration date using the calendar widget.

## Maximum Temperature

The maximum permitted temperature for storing the Naloxone nasal spray is typically 104 degrees Fahrenheit. You can adjust this temperature by using the slider. The label next to it will display the current temperature setting. If the maximum temperature is reached, the system will display a red pill icon in the bottom right corner of the screen. It is also recommended enabling SMS reporting so that the admin can be notified of the incident, as there is no way to prevent the use of overheated Naloxone.

## Expiration Date

This feature displays the expiration date of the Naloxone in the safety kit. Once the Naloxone has expired, the system will display a red bill icon in the bottom right corner of the screen. It is also recommended enabling SMS reporting so that the admin can be notified of the incident, as there is no way to prevent the use of expired Naloxone.
