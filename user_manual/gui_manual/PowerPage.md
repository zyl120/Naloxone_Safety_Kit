# Power

The Power page allows you to control the power consumption of the device as well as cooling options.

## Enable Active Cooling

This option allows you to enable or disable the active cooling feature on the device. It is recommended to have a cooling fan installed to quickly remove hot air from the device. When this option is enabled, the cooling fan will turn on as needed. If it is disabled, the fan will always be off.

## Threshold Temperature

This is the minimum temperature at which the cooling fan will turn on. It is recommended to set this value to 176 degrees to minimize noise. A linear relationship between temperature and fan speed will be used.

## Brightness

This allows you to adjust the brightness of the display.
